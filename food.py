        reason for instance vaiables and not class variables 
        better for food instance to have its own values for x, y and width and height as food will have his own unique position
        and size on the screen
        class variables  would have all instances of food sharing the same position and size
        the same goes for the colour, instance is needed to maintain independnece for other food objects
        class variable would be useful only if all food objects must have the same color and size

        defense for the parameters
        x and y neccesary for position of the food on the x and y axis, width and height needed to specify width and height of food
        colour needed to specify what colour food enemy will be
